### Hi dude, my name is CÃ¡ssio Tieres ðŸ‘‹


Hi, my name Cassio, I've been a developer for just over 1 year. I am self-taught, but I intend to enter the Information Systems faculty.
I'm currently studying Web Development at Udemy, from basic to advanced, with a grid that goes from HTML and CSS, to PHP, Bootstrap, MySQL, JavaScript, and IONIC. I've also been studying Python for a long time, which was my first language, so I'll go deeper into back-end development with Django and Flask. 

### A little more about me:
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on RN ServiÃ§os
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning JavaScript, Python...
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Web / Desktop projects
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Unity Engine
- ðŸ“« You find me on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/c%C3%A1ssio-tieres-bomfim-99573a179/)
