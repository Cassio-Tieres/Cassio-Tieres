### Hi dude, my name is Cássio Tieres 🕷️


Hi, my name Cassio, I've been a developer for just over 1 year. I am self-taught, but I intend to enter the Information Systems faculty.
I'm currently studying Web Development at Udemy, from basic to advanced, with a grid that goes from HTML and CSS, to PHP, Bootstrap, MySQL, JavaScript, and IONIC. I've also been studying Python for a long time, which was my first language, so I'll go deeper into back-end development with Django and Flask. 

## Technologies I am working and studying:

* 👨‍💻 C#
* 👨‍⚕️ Python
* 💻 HTML
* 🕸️ CSS
* 🤖 JavaScript
